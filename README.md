# Jimmy Lewis Discord Bot
Discord bot for the Jimmy Lewis Moves to Fort Wayne Discord server. Everything can and will be hard coded because this is a very specific server bot.

### Current Features:
- React with the :drake: emoji every time Drake says anything in the server.

### To Run/Test Yourself:
Create a config.py with this variable set with your own bot token. It must be in the same folder as jimmy_lewis.py for the import to work properly.
```
bot_token = "INSERT TOKEN HERE AS STRING"
```

### APIs Used:
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
